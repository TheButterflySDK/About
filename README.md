# About The Butterfly SDK

## TL;DR
Let’s stop the domestic violence together. You can use our SDK for sending reports to our help centers, from your mobile app.


## Longer explanation below 🤓

The Butterfly SDK is your chance to take an active part, in the fight against domestic violence.

### How? (what do we suggest?) 😯
Are you a mobile developer? Do you own a mobile application? That’s awesome! Now you can embed our **open-source** project inside your app and help us collect reports from anyone in a need, globally!

### Privacy, stability and security 🤝
Our SDK is super lite and harmless, you can check our public code online in GitHub, it doesn’t require any special permission and won’t operate by itself. All you have to do is to initiate our reporter in case the user wants to (you’ll need an API key for that) and we’ll take it from there.

### Plug n' Play 🔌
We’re currently available for easy installation in iOS, Android and Flutter.


Thanks and good luck to us all!
