## TL;DR
Let‚Äôs stop the domestic violence together. Use our SDK to allow your users consult with domestic violence experts around the world, discreetly, from your mobile app or website.


## Full explanation below ü§ì

#### The Butterfly Button is your chance to take an active part in the fight against domestic violence.

### How? (what do we suggest?) üòØ
Do you own a mobile application or website? That‚Äôs awesome! Now you can put our **open-source** button inside your app / website and help anyone in a need, globally!

### Privacy, stability and security ü§ù
Our SDK is light, free to use, super easy to install and harmless. You can check out our public code online in [GitHub](https://github.com/TheButterflySDK?tab=repositories), it doesn‚Äôt require any special permission and won‚Äôt operate by itself. All you need to do is to present our reporter in case the user wants to (you‚Äôll need an API key for that) and we‚Äôll take it from there.

### Obtain an API key üîë
Fill in our [registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfNEQdh6BIZ0BH5RTQoh1Sc7IWkPLolOnIcltLhtQ79XbmSnw/viewform) and we'll be happy to assist and provide your new API key.

### Plug n' Play üîå
We‚Äôre currently available for easy installation in [web](https://github.com/TheButterflySDK/Web), [iOS](https://github.com/TheButterflySDK/iOS), [Android](https://github.com/TheButterflySDK/Android) and [Flutter for mobile](https://github.com/TheButterflySDK/Flutter).


## User experience when using the Butterfly Button
So you decided to embed the butterfly button in your app - that's great!

### Where would you put it?
Anyware you like, it's your app. We don't attempt to hide the button although its usage is hidden. You may put it in a convenient place inside your app.

Our suggestion is to put it in the app's settings screen, because almost every app has its own "Settings Screen".

You can find our examples ([example 1](https://butterfly-button.web.app/videos/Usage-Example-1.mp4) and [example 2](https://butterfly-button.web.app/videos/Usage-Example-2.mp4)) to get some inspiration.

Thanks and good luck to us all!
