## TL;DR
Let‚Äôs stop the domestic violence together. You can use our SDK for sending reports to our help centers, from your mobile app.


## Full explanation below ü§ì

The Butterfly SDK is your chance to take an active part, in the fight against domestic violence.

### How? (what do we suggest?) üòØ
Are you a mobile developer? Do you own a mobile application? That‚Äôs awesome! Now you can embed our **open-source** project inside your app and help us collect reports from anyone in a need, globally!

### Privacy, stability and security ü§ù
Our SDK is light, free to use, super easy to install and harmless. You can check out our public code online in [GitHub](https://github.com/TheButterflySDK?tab=repositories), it doesn‚Äôt require any special permission and won‚Äôt operate by itself. All you need to do is to call our reporter in case the user wants to (you‚Äôll need an API key for that) and we‚Äôll take it from there.

### Obtain an API key üîë
Feel free to fill in our [registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfNEQdh6BIZ0BH5RTQoh1Sc7IWkPLolOnIcltLhtQ79XbmSnw/viewform) and we'll be happy to assist and provide your API key.

### Plug n' Play üîå
We‚Äôre currently available for easy installation in [iOS](https://github.com/TheButterflySDK/iOS), [Android](https://github.com/TheButterflySDK/Android) and [Flutter](https://github.com/TheButterflySDK/Flutter).


## User experience when using the Butterfly button
So you decided to embed the butterfly button in your app - that's awesome!
### Where would you put it?
Anyware you like, it's your app. We don't try to hide the button, its actions are hidden. So you may put it in a convenient place inside your app.

Our suggestion is to put it in the app's settings screen, because almost every app has its own "Settings Screen".

You can find our examples ([example 1](https://butterfly-host.web.app/videos/Usage-Example-1.mp4) and [example 2](https://butterfly-host.web.app/videos/Usage-Example-2.mp4)) to get some inspiration.

Thanks and good luck to us all!
