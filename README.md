## TL;DR
Let’s stop the domestic violence together. You can use our SDK for sending reports to our help centers, from your mobile app.


## Full explanation below 🤓

The Butterfly SDK is your chance to take an active part, in the fight against domestic violence.

### How? (what do we suggest?) 😯
Are you a mobile developer? Do you own a mobile application? That’s awesome! Now you can embed our **open-source** project inside your app and help us collect reports from anyone in a need, globally!

### Privacy, stability and security 🤝
Our SDK is light, free to use, super easy to install and harmless. You can check out our public code online in [GitHub](https://github.com/TheButterflySDK?tab=repositories), it doesn’t require any special permission and won’t operate by itself. All you need to do is to call our reporter in case the user wants to (you’ll need an API key for that) and we’ll take it from there.

### Obtain an API key
Untill we'll make a nice registration online form, feel free to contact the [dev team](http://www.linkedin.com/in/perrysh) directly and we'll be happy to assist.

### Plug n' Play 🔌
We’re currently available for easy installation in [iOS](https://github.com/TheButterflySDK/iOS), [Android](https://github.com/TheButterflySDK/Android) and [Flutter](https://github.com/TheButterflySDK/Flutter).

Thanks and good luck to us all!
